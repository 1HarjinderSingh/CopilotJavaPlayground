## General Principles
- Write code that is **readable, maintainable and well-structured**.
- Follow the ** DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle** to avoid redundancy.
- Use **descriptive variable and function names** (e.g., `calculate_total` instead of `calc`).
- Keep code ** simple and concise** while ensuring clarity-**avoid over-engineering**.
- Use Collections and Generics:
    - Prefer using collections like List, Set, and Map over arrays.
    - Use generics to ensure type safety.
- Avoid Magic Numbers:
    - Use constants instead of hardcoding numbers.
    - Handle Exceptions Properly:
- Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
- Use Collections and Generics:
    - Prefer using collections like List, Set, and Map over arrays.
    - Use generics to ensure type safety.
- Use Design Patterns:
    - Apply appropriate design patterns to solve common problems.
- Write Unit Tests:
    - Ensure your code is covered by unit tests to verify its correctness.
- Optimize Imports:
    - Only import the classes you need.
- Use Access Modifiers:
    - Use private, protected, and public access modifiers appropriately to encapsulate your code.
- Do not use multimodule project 
- When converting multimodule project to single module project, move code to packages
