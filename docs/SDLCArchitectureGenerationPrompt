Role: Act as a Principal Systems Architect and Creative Lead. Objective: Create a high-fidelity, 3D isometric layered architecture diagram illustrating an "AI-Augmented SDLC." The style must be professional, futuristic, and highly polished, suitable for a C-suite presentation.
Architectural Layering (Top to Bottom):
The Overarching Interface Layer: * A floating, semi-transparent glass-morphism pane that spans the entire width of the diagram.
Label: "Developer Portal (Unified Interaction Hub)".
Include glowing, high-detail icons for the Story Writer Agent and a ChatBot, showing they are the entry points for all SDLC personas.
The Agentic SDLC Execution Layer: * A thick, modular 3D platform divided into six distinct, connected blocks representing: Planning, Design, Development, Testing, Build & Deploy, and Maintenance.
Planning: Show "Story Writer Agent" facilitating PMs and Scrum Masters.
Design: Show "DevY Architect Agent" generating artifacts.
Development: Feature "DevY Agent" inside IDEs, alongside "Cursor" and "Devin/Copilot" as autonomous coding agents.
Testing: Show "Test Agent" generating functional cases.
Build & Deploy: Show "Pipeline Agent" and "Compliance Agent" as gatekeepers.
Maintenance: Show "Watcher Agent" monitoring logs.
The Foundational Context Layer: * A solid, glowing base layer labeled "ComponentSpaces (Enterprise Context Engine & Knowledge Graph)".
Visualized as a neural mesh or glowing grid that acts as the data source.
Use vertical beams of light (data streams) rising from this base to "power" the agents in the layers above, replacing messy connector lines.
Visual Aesthetic & Finish:
Palette: Soothing deep blues, frosted whites, and "Electric Teal" accents for AI components.
Perspective: Front-right 3D isometric view.
Quality: Crisp edges, soft ambient occlusion shadows, and a clean, neutral background. Use professional sans-serif typography for all labels.
